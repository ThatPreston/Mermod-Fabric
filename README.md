## Description

Mermod adds a necklace that gives players mermaid tails upon contact with water, 

Necklaces can be dyed any color by combining them with dyes in the crafting grid, When a necklace is dyed; the player's tail will be the same color as the necklace's crystal, the necklace can be worn by placing it in the chestplate slot or optionally an accessory slot if the [Curios mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) or the [Trinkets mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets) is installed.

Starting in version 1.8 of the mod; the necklace gives dolphin's grace, water breathing, and night vision underwater if worn in a trinket slot. These effects can be disabled inside the mermod config itself at any time, Merlings from the [Origins mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) will have a white mermaid tail by default and custom origins can also be given tails of any color.
